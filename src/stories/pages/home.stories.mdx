# Welcome to Design System

<p className="text-md">
  Design System helps you build UI pages using our pre-build components in
  isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. Save these UI
  states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
</p>

<br />

<ul className="dont">
  <li className="dont">
    You can't build an Component out of this context if is is a sharable.
  </li>
  <li className="dont">
    You can build a Page as component - You can't add colors, fonts, etc. that
    are not part of the design system
  </li>
  <li className="dont">You can't add business logic to the design system</li>
  <li className="dont">You can't add data to the design system</li>

# Guidelines while coding

Although a design system is used to build the UI of the app and it describes a set of rules we also have a guideline that help you build better code.

## Kiss:

Keep it Simple and Stupid, do not over-engineer; (really do not).

## Clean Code:

Your code must be easy to understand and easy to maintain.

## YAGN:

You Aren't Gonna Need It (avoid creating extra complexity that you assume you may need in the future)

## DRY:

Do not Repeat Yourself. Be aware we have a bunch of functions and its correct layer to existing.

## Small PR:

Small Pull Request is the best way to ensure the health and quality of our code.

## Code Review:

While reviewing a colleague's Pull Request pay attention to all this important stuff.

## Peer Code:

Big task at hand? Start it off with brainstorming with a colleague.

## WIP:

Big holiday coming? Awesome!, Just do not forget to push your code to the repo.

## Commits Pattern:

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) pattern to ensure a consistent commit history.
